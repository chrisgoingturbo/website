            <p>
              trackmyprop is a desktop workspace for traders who operate across
              prop firms, accounts, platforms, rules, and payout cycles. It
              brings account tracking, trade journaling, challenge management,
              trading tools, and operational records into one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              I lead the product direction, user experience, interface design,
              and implementation of trackmyprop. I use AI agents throughout
              research, development, testing, and iteration while retaining
              responsibility for the decisions and final quality.
            </p>
          </CaseSection>

          <CaseSection title="The problem">
            <p>
              Prop-firm traders do more than place trades. They monitor different
              account states, follow firm-specific rules, review executions,
              track fees and payouts, and keep evidence of their progress. That
              work is often split across broker platforms, spreadsheets, notes,
              calculators, and community support conversations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The design challenge is to make that complexity visible without
              making the product feel complicated: enough density for serious
              desktop work, with clear hierarchy and language that remains
              understandable under pressure.
            </p>
          </CaseSection>

          <CaseSection title="Domain knowledge as a design input">
            <p>
              I came to the product as both a futures trader and someone who had
              worked directly with prop-firm traders through community, support,
              affiliate, and growth roles. Those conversations exposed recurring
              friction: unclear rule calculations, fragmented account history,
              repetitive support questions, and poor visibility into what needs
              attention next.
            </p>
            <p>
              That experience informs the product vocabulary, information
              architecture, safety language, and the decision to treat accounts,
              challenges, trades, payouts, and costs as connected parts of one
              workflow rather than isolated dashboards.

          <CaseSection title="Desktop-first by design">
            <p>
              trackmyprop is built as an Electron desktop application for macOS
              and Windows. That choice supports wide, information-dense layouts,
              keyboard-led navigation, local workflows, and a persistent workspace
              that can sit beside trading software throughout the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The trade-off is deliberate: the core product is not compressed
              into a mobile dashboard. The public website, account surfaces, and
              supporting brand materials handle the web-facing part of the product
              while the main operational experience remains desktop-first.
            </p>
          </CaseSection>

          <CaseSection title="Design system and implementation">
            <p>
              The interface is built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and
              reusable primitives backed by accessible component foundations.
              Shared tokens separate the page, card, sidebar, overlay, and state
              layers; reusable patterns cover controls, dialogs, data rows,
              navigation, status feedback, and responsive marketing surfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              The product website and brand system use the same restrained visual
              language: neutral surfaces, compact typography, practical motion,
              and screenshots that show the actual application rather than a
              separate marketing fiction.
            </p>
          </CaseSection>

          <CaseSection title="AI in the workflow">
            <p>
              I use AI agents to accelerate research, implementation, testing,
              and iteration while retaining ownership of the product direction,
              design decisions, and final quality. The repository includes the
              working rules, product context, review practices, and verification
              steps those agents use.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI is useful here because the product spans interface design,
              desktop engineering, broker integrations, documentation, and quality
              assurance. It increases execution capacity; it does not replace the
              judgment needed to decide what belongs in the product or whether the
              result is good enough.

              <li>Different prop firms and broker platforms expose different rules, data, and connection limits.</li>

              <li>Live or unavailable states must be communicated honestly, especially around trading and account safety.</li>
              <li>A private-beta product needs room to evolve without making the navigation and component system feel temporary.</li>

          <CaseSection title="Current state and lessons">
            <p>
              trackmyprop is in private beta and active development. The current
              desktop product covers portfolio and account tracking, prop-firm
              journeys, trade journaling, calculations, records, an economic
              calendar, and trade-copier workflows, with connection coverage and

            <p>
              The central lesson has been that domain knowledge matters most when
              it becomes product structure: clearer terminology, safer defaults,
              connected records, and explanations that help a trader decide what
              to do next.
